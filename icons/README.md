# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Grammar Check Pro Chrome extension:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (extension icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icons should represent grammar/writing assistance. Ideas:
- A pencil with a checkmark
- A document with a magnifying glass
- The letter "G" with writing/editing elements
- A speech bubble with correction marks

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online tools like Canva, Figma, or IconMaker
- Image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP
- Free icon websites (ensure you have proper licensing)

## Color Scheme
- Primary: #4285f4 (Google Blue)
- Accent: #34a853 (Green for corrections)
- Background: White or transparent

The current extension uses a blue "G" logo in the popup, so the icons should match this branding.
